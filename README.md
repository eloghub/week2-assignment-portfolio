Grading Requirements:

+application resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the homework instructions


+repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.


NOTES/CHALLENGES:

+when including images, I used relative links for two photos that are in a specific folder in this repository, then I hyperlinked the third (header) image.

+lines 17-20 (HTML) - I created anchor links in the navigation bar to link to the four h2s. Initially I struggled because I forgot to put the # in front of the id names.

+all h2s needed to floated left, while their corresponding content was floated right.
