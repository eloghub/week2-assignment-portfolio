+the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the applications when the link to the section about their work is clicked on

+the application's image should be larger in size than the others when the application is initially loaded

+a user is taken to that deployed application when images of the applications are clicked on

Grading Requirements:

+application resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the homework instructions


+repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.


NOTES/CHALLENGES:

+when including images, I used relative links for two photos that are in a specific folder in this repository, then I hyperlinked the third (header) image.

+lines 16-19 (HTML) - I created anchor links in the navigation bar to link to the four h2s. Initially I struggled because I forgot to put the # in front of the id names.

+all h2s needed to floated left, while their corresponding content was floated right.

+somewhere along the way I misplaced my header background image and was unable to retrace my steps.

+I realized that instead of creating separate divs for each nav item, I could instead create "sections" in the HTML file (so they were also commented out in the css file).
